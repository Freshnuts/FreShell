# FreShell
A programming project to further educate myself in Python Subprocess, Sockets, I/O, Error Handling, & Threading.
The objective use of this program is Remote Administration Tool(RAT). Users are provided with a remote 
interactive shell, or may choose an automated task (ex. Download/Upload File).

I will be adding more options to this project sequentially. FreShell will be easily editable & scalable using
structural programming. In the future I will be continuing this project onto C Programming language and see how
it goes from there ;p

##Running on Debian Linux##

Next Few Updates Notes:KL, Threading Notes: <br />

-Adding proper error handling for all functions
-threading connect() for multiple client connections<br />
-update option "4" to read ALL clients & if connected realtime<br />
-Threading Keylogger to run in background & the ability to deploy multiple<br />
ADDING:<br />
-File Exfiltration/Data Extrusion from apps and files<br />
-Open Backdoor/Bind Shell Persistence<br />
-Reverse Shell Persistence with Cron/At<br />
