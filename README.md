# FreShell
A programming project to further educate myself in Python Subprocess, Sockets, I/O, Error Handling, & Threading.<br />
The objective use of this program is a Reverse Shell. Users are provided with a remote <br />
interactive shell, or may choose an automated task (ex. Download/Upload File).<br />

I will be adding more options to this project sequentially. FreShell will be easily editable & scalable using<br />
structural programming. In the future I will be continuing this project onto C Programming language and see how<br />
it goes from there ;p<br />

##Running on Debian Linux##<br />
