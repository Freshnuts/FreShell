# FreShell
A programming project of mine to further educate myself in Python Subprocess, Sockets, I/O, & Threading.
The objective use of this program is Remote Administration Tool(RAT). Users are provided with a remote 
interactive shell, or may choose an automated task (ex. Download/Upload File).

I will be adding more options to this project sequentially. FreShell will be easily editable & scalable using
structural programming. In the future I will be continuing this project onto C Programming language and see how
it goes from there ;p
