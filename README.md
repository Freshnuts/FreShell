# FreShell
A programming project to further educate myself in Python Subprocess, Sockets, I/O, Error Handling, & Threading.<br />
The objective use of this program is a Reverse Shell. Users are provided with a remote <br />
interactive shell, or may choose an automated task (ex. Download/Upload File).<br />

I will be adding more options to this project sequentially. FreShell will be easily editable & scalable using<br />
structural programming. In the future I will be continuing this project onto C Programming language and see how<br />
it goes from there ;p<br />

##Running on Debian Linux##<br />

<h1> Update for freShell 7/9/17</h1>
I am abandoning this project as a RAT and keeping it as Reverse Shell. Reason being, I had<br />
to change this program's source code completely to have it function properly with<br />
multiprocessing capabilites for multiple clients. Currently, I am working on the<br />
"freshRAT", which is actually a RAT. Along, with FreshBot, which is my botnet project.<br />

-Adding proper error handling for all functions<br />
ADDING:<br />
-File Exfiltration/Data Extrusion from apps and files<br />
-Open Backdoor/Bind Shell Persistence<br />
-Reverse Shell Persistence with Cron/At<br />
